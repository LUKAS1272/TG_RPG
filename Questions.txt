x	How to create an inventory system? (arrayList, interface, var)
x	- The inventory has to be able to hold any item regardless of the data type			
>>>	Polymorphism	

x	Can an item have a weight of 0?
>>>	Yes

x	Do I have to unit test the methods, that are dependent on:
x 	- Random values (private properties, for which it doesn't make sense to have a get set)
x	- User input (Console.ReadKey, Console.ReadLine)
x		-> For example Character.ChangeEquipment()
>>> Test random methods using seed, don't test input dependent methods

x	Is "class for stackable an unstackable items" supposed to be something like class for Copper / Silver / Gold?
x	- I will create a class hereditary towards the class Item and it will have some specific method
x	  -> Letter : Item > Read()
x	  -> Food : Item > Eat()
>>>	Yes -> Create Stackable : Item and then using polymorphism create an individual items

x	Does class Character have to have values for strength, endurance, etc.?
x	- Or can I make attack, maxHP, and other random values fully random?
>>>	Yes, it does have to
